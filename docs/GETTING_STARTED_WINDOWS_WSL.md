## Installing fonts for Linux shell themese (zsh)
- When running linux on WSL, you cannot install fonts using `apt`, instead it is easier to download the font `ttf` file on the browser, unzip the file (if not done so already) and run `install`. This will install the font on your windows machine, but since windows is still used to render characters on the terminal, the font will be available to use on Linux shell.
